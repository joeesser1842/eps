## Project Overview
This is the Electical Power System module of the inspireFly Cubesat.

The main goal of the Electrical Power System a.k.a. EPS, is to manage the cubesat's power intake, battery charge, and power usage to ensure the operation of the satellite.

## Educational Value Added
This project will provide students the oppurtunity to learn about power supply design, such as how DC-DC converters work, how to charge batteries with solar panels, and how to test power systems.
In addition, this project will give students the oppurtunity to learn schematic design, PCB board design, how to perform basic and advanced soldering, experience in embedded systems programming.

## Tasks
1. Update the schematic with instock parts <br>
2. Review the shcematic with advisors <br>
3. Update the PCB board with the new schematic <br>
4. Review the PCB board with advisors <br>
5. Begin constructing the PCB board <br>
6. Test the board <br>
